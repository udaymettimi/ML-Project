Diabetes Prediction App
This is a web-based application developed using Streamlit, which allows users to predict whether they have diabetes based on input parameters like pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and other health factors. The app utilizes a machine learning model to make predictions.

Overview
The Diabetes Prediction app takes input values such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age, and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether the user has diabetes. The app displays the prediction result as either "You have Diabetes" or "You don't have Diabetes."

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for development.
Streamlit: The framework for building the web app.
Pickle: Used to load and save the trained machine learning model.
scikit-learn: The machine learning library that was likely used to build the model (if applicable).
How to Use
Open the app in a web browser.
Enter the following details in the input fields:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Click the "Predict" button.
Based on the input values, the app will predict whether you have diabetes or not.
Installation
To run this app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (if applicable):

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
Install the required packages: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, and then install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install the libraries manually:

bash
Copy
pip install streamlit pickle-mixin scikit-learn
Run the app: Navigate to the project directory and run the app with Streamlit:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
The app will start, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Model Details
The machine learning model used in this app is a pre-trained model for diabetes prediction. It was trained on a dataset with various health parameters and the corresponding outcomes for whether the individual has diabetes or not. The model is saved as diabetes_model.sav and is loaded into the app using pickle.

Notes:
Make sure to add the actual location for your model file (diabetes_model.sav) in the diabetes_model_path when running the app locally.
You may also want to provide a requirements.txt file if youâ€™re distributing the code. You can generate it by running:
bash
Copy
pip freeze > requirements.txt
